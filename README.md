# Hi, I'm Jacob! 

### I'm a solutions engineer at [beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com), a self-taught software engineer, and a former [award-winning investigative journalist](https://www.jacobwolf.report/).

I work on a number of different apps at beehiiv, including [beehiiv.com](https://www.beehiiv.com) (NextJS), the beehiiv app (Ruby on Rails, React, Postgres, and ClickHouse), the beehiiv Public API (Ruby on Rails), and the Make and Zapier no-code tools, both which are written in JavaScript. I've built internal tooling in Retool, ZenDesk, and Slack and support our enterprise customers — like [The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com) and [The Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org) — in integrating their technologies with our platform.

I also work on open source projects, like [is-emoji-supported](https://github.com/JacobNWolf/is-emoji-supported), and freelance on projects in Astro, React, TypeScript, WordPress, PHP, and more.

I'm an avid reader, and I'm always looking for my next great book. I'm also an amateur pitmaster and love exploring Texas barbecue.

I'm based in Austin, Texas, and I'm always looking to learn new technologies and improve my craft.
